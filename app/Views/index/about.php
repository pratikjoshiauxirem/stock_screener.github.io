        <p class="mt-2 lead">If you're a part-time investor with a full-time job, most stock research platforms are not designed for you</p>
        <p class="mt-2 lead">These tools were built by finance professionals for finance professionals.</p>
        <p class="mt-2 lead">Finance pros are used to scanning dense tables filled with ratios and comparing the numbers in their head or in complex excel models.</p>
        <p class="mt-2 lead">But why should non-pros analyze stocks with the same tools? </p>
        <p class="mt-2 lead">Yahoo Finance is a great place to quickly look up a P/E ratio, or pull a stock's latest financial statements. But to do thorough analysis, you don't just need data, 
            you need to interpret that data to make an informed investment decision.</p>
